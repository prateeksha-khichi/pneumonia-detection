🧠 Pneumonia Detection Using Deep Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a deep learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model learns to classify whether a person has pneumonia or not. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia).


📂 Dataset
Source: Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) – Kaggle

Structure:

train/: Training images (Normal / Pneumonia)

test/: Testing images (Normal / Pneumonia)

val/: Validation images (Normal / Pneumonia)


🚀 Project Goals
Preprocess and explore chest X-ray image data.

Train a deep learning model (CNN) to classify chest X-rays.


We used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following configuration:

Convolutional layers + MaxPooling

Dropout for regularization

Fully Connected Layers

Softmax/ Sigmoid output layer (binary classification)

Alternatively, transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50, or EfficientNet can also be implemented for better accuracy and faster convergence.


🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas

OpenCV / PIL

Matplotlib / Seaborn


🧼 Preprocessing Steps
Resizing images (e.g., 150x150 or 224x224)

Normalization (pixel value scaling)

Image augmentation (rotation, zoom, flipping)

Train-validation-test split


🧠 Future Improvements
Deploy model with a web interface (Flask/Streamlit)

Use ensemble models for better performance
